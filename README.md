Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology

Implemented algorithms:
* Brute method,
* Method based on BFS algorithm,
* Method based on DFS algorithm,
* Weisfeiler-Lehman's method,
* Method based on graph spectrum comparison.

Application provides 3 types of tests:
* single test for given graphs,
* many tests for an increasing number of vertices.
* many tests for an increasing number of edges.
